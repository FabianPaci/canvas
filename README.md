# Version
This is obviously not usable, the reasons behind the few commits before version 1.00 are for development purposes only.

# canvas
A simple drawing app

# Motivation
There is no bloat free drawing app out there, especially not as efficient and cross platform as this one :)
This is also a learning experience with it being my first Dear Imgui project I'm working on :)

# Todo
version progression including checklists and feature requests are available in a pinned issue, currently available [here](https://github.com/FabianPaci/canvas/issues/1)
